# VS Code Template Manager Templates

Here are some templates to use with the [File Templates Manager](https://github.com/3axap4eHko/file-templates-manager#readme) extension for VS Code.

## Installation

Note: You should fork this project!

Clone the repo to a location of your choice.

```
git clone git@github.com:tjventurini/vscode-template-manager-templates.git
```

Then copy the templates into your VS Code setup.

```
cp vscode-template-manager-templates/* ~/.config/Code\ -\ Insiders/User/globalStorage/3axap4ehko.file-templates-manager/
```

Note: You will probably need to adapt the paths to match the locations on your system.

## Update Repo

Once you did some changes to the templates in VS Code or you add some new ones, you probably want to update the repo. To do so, just copy the files back to the repo and commit and push.

```
cp ~/.config/Code\ -\ Insiders/User/globalStorage/3axap4ehko.file-templates-manager/* vscode-template-manager-templates/
```

## Troubleshooting

I did not manage to use the repo directly in the template manager I guess it's because of the `.git` folder in it ðŸ¤·
